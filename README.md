# Why did we choose an ArrayList?
- Easier to implement than linked lists
- More intuitive
- More robust
- Not the most efficient, but it helps us get a grasp of how Deque works
- Because it allows for cleaner, more understandable, and nicer code
- It is C00L

# Method implementations for Deque for type T:
- addFirst(T)
- removeFirst()
- peekFirst()
- addLast(T)
- removeLast()
- peekLast()
<br>
rationale: These methods expand on what Queue does and allows for adding and removing from both the front and the end of the list.
